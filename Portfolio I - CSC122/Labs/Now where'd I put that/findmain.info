*                 Lab: Now where'd I put that                           *
*                                                                       *
* This program shows the use of find functions which take in a base     *
* string to be searched, along with a char/string to look for. It will  *
* search the base for it, and then return that int index where it was   *
* found, or std::string::npos if it was not found.                      *
*                                                                       *
* Base Level: 2                                                         *
* Options Chosen:                                                       *
*   Level 1: Case-sensitivit argument.                                  *
*   Level 2: User can use wildcards to represent 0+ chars, and ?        *
*            to represent 1 char. Escape sequence char '/' added.       *
*   Level 3: User can use multiple wildcards in one input string.       *
* Total Level: 2+1+2+3 = 8                                              *
