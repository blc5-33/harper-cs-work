*                   Lab: "Hi" == "hi"?                                  *
*                                                                       *
*  In this lab I designed a function that is a case-insensitive version *
* of the |strcmp()| function found in the <cstring> library. It works   *
* almost the exact same way as the original function, with the same     *
* return value rules as defined in the standard, again just accounting  *
* for the case-insensitivity.                                           *
*                                                                       *

*   No options attempted.                                               *
